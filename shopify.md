# RetailOS for Shopify – App Landing Page

We're launching RetailOS as a native Shopify app — and it’s more than just another plugin. It's a **superintelligent AI sales agent** that lives on your storefront, talks to customers, and increases your AOV, LTV, and checkout conversion.

This page should be scrollable, punchy, and have a **green color theme** in line with Shopify branding.

## Hero Section

**Headline:**

## Section 2: Personalized AI That Understands Your Brand

Once installed, RetailOS:
- Uses the Shopify API to learn your brand’s tone, customer segments, and product taxonomy
- Automatically creates a **custom internal product database** with intelligent tagging:
  - Use-case based (e.g., “gift for runners”, “daily skin routine”)
  - Occasion-based (e.g., “wedding kit”, “beach trip”)
- Builds natural bundles and supplementary product suggestions
- Recommends products **based on real context**, not random rules

## Section 3: LTV — Loyalty on Autopilot

- The AI doesn’t just sell — it remembers.
- After a customer makes a purchase, the agent:
  - Personalizes future recommendations
  - Sends **custom follow-ups** (email or on-site)
  - Builds a relationship that leads to repeat purchases
- This boosts **LTV and retention** — the real drivers of long-term profit.

## Section 4: Abandoned Cart Recovery

- Most Shopify stores lose sales at checkout.
- RetailOS solves this in two ways:
  1. **At the beginning of a visit**, the agent offers a limited-time incentive in exchange for an email. *(Configurable by you.)*
  2. **At the end**, it nudges users with personalized prompts, checkout help, or additional offers.
- Result: More carts convert. Less revenue lost.

**CTA:** [Join the Beta] → `/shopify/join`

## Section 5: The AI Advantage Snowball

- Our AI learns from real customer interactions.
- Beta users get an early edge:
  - More time to train your agent
  - Better responses, faster personalization
  - Head start before competitors enter the ecosystem
- In AI sales, **time = intelligence**. The earlier you start, the better your results.

**Tagline:** Be first. Be smarter. Snowball the advantage.
