## Section 4: De-risked Deployment

We know large retailers can’t gamble on untested tech. That’s why we run **structured pilot programs**:

- Start with a limited rollout in a low-risk channel.  
- Measure uplift in AOV, LTV, and cart recovery.  
- Audit performance with your team.  
- Scale only when the ROI is proven.  

This ensures **no surprises** — only data-backed decisions.
