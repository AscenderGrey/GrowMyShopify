# RetailOS Homepage — Narrative Scroll Version

RetailOS is an AI-powered sales agent platform for ecommerce stores. It provides branded AI agents that guide, convert, and remember every visitor. This homepage should feel **confident, inevitable, and deeply useful**. Visitors should feel they’ve seen the future of ecommerce.

## Tone & Design
- Minimal, serious, modern.
- Light animation on scroll is fine.
- Layout: long, scrollable page that reads like a story.
- CTAs appear every 1–2 sections.
- Use section dividers or visual cues to pace the scroll.

## Section 1: Hero

**Headline:**  
What if every visitor had a personal AI sales expert?

**Subheadline:**  
RetailOS gives your store a superintelligent AI agent that greets and guides each customer — with one goal: increasing AOV, LTV, and reducing abandoned carts.

**CTA Buttons (side-by-side):**
- Book a Strategy Call → `/book-call`
- Join Shopify Waitlist → `/shopify`

---

## Section 2: The Pain

- Abandoned carts are the silent killer of ecommerce.
- Most customers leave without buying — not because of price, but because they’re confused, lost, or unsupported.
- Loyalty is dropping. LTV is shrinking.
- Customers forget you. And you forget them.

## Section 3: Enter RetailOS

  - Greets every customer on your site
  - Understands your catalog
  - Remembers returning customers
  - Helps them find exactly what they need
  - Learns your tone and adapts
- This is not live chat. This is not a dumb bot.
- This is your new top-performing salesperson.

## Section 4: Built for Scale

- Works out of the box for Shopify stores
- Integrates fully with custom stacks
- Works 24/7, never guesses, always sells
- Learns from real interactions — not just clicks

**CTA:** [Book a Demo] → `/book-call`

## Section 5: Real Data, Not Clicks

- Heatmaps and click tracking only tell you where people gave up.
- RetailOS gives you real qualitative data:
  - What customers asked
  - What confused them
  - What they liked and disliked
  - What stopped them from buying
- It’s like user research at scale, every day.

**CTA:** [Talk to Sales] → `/book-call`

---

## Section 6: AI That Gets Smarter

- Every interaction makes your agent better.
- Learns your brand voice, pricing strategy, objections, goals.
- Fine-tune behavior from a simple internal dashboard.
- You can train it. Or let it learn naturally.

---

## Section 7: Guardrails + Trust

- Hardcoded guardrails to prevent hallucination.
- Never guesses. Never lies. Fully auditable.
- AI with safety by design, not as an afterthought.
