# RetailOS Landing Page – Homepage

RetailOS is a system designed to increase ecommerce store performance by deploying an AI-powered sales agent to interact with every visitor in real time.

The page should feel:
- Clean
- Modern
- Trustworthy
- Lightly technical, but friendly

## Hero Section

**Headline:**  
What if every visitor had a personal AI sales expert?

**Subheadline:**  
RetailOS gives your store a superintelligent AI agent that greets and guides each visitor — with one goal: increasing AOV, LTV, and reducing abandoned carts.

**CTAs (side by side on desktop):**
- [Book a Strategy Call] → `/book-call`
- [Join Shopify Waitlist] → `/shopify`

## How It Works

- The AI lives on your site, as a branded, on-site assistant.
- It interacts with visitors in real time.
- It learns from your catalog and policies.
- It never sleeps, never guesses, and is always optimized to sell.
- Built with a focus on trust, data security, and conversion science.
